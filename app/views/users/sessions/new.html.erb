    Hi, I'm Jordan Colgan and I came up with this website so we can match volunteers willing to help the healthcare heroes and essential worker warriors who are working around the clock to fight and win the war against COVID-19. THANK YOU.

    <br><br>

    As a high school junior in Cook County, IL, I have friends whose parents are balancing increased work hours with kids who are suddenly at home and they need assistance.
